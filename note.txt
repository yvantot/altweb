The Goal
- Bookmarks support
- App info, links to other tools & donation


Flow
- Alt + ArrowKeys = [<-,->] Tab selection, [^, v] Mode selection [Windows, Bookmarks]
- Alt + E = Search for a tab

Browser Extension API Limitation
1. Content script cannot be injected to new tab, option tab, or anything Chrome disallows.
2. Screenshot is only possible for current tab.

Possible solution for the Limitation
[/] 1. Create  a popup-html for it, and use Commands & Windows API if injecting is not allowed
[X] 2. Store screenshots at visits, and pull imgs from storage based on their domain, but the problem is it's not updated... or store is as a session?!
[X] 2. Use window popups to preview tabs
[/] 2. Use window to preview tabs silently and add show them while picking and store them on storage, then delete them based on max age

Possible implementation problems
1. If my extension loads before the webpage, the possibility of my elements being overwritten is high (some websites are weird)
2. Possible CSS inheritance bleeding which will make my injected element look different throughout different website
3. Existing commands will make my shortcuts obsolete if the website has it.
4. Some sites are so fucking slow that my scripts are blocked.

Possible implementation solutions
[x] 1. I can use setInterval forever to check if my element is appended, if not, then append. 
[/] 1. Element attachment is based on user-input, so this problem is solved by design.
[/] 2. Use of all: initial. Use of shadowDOM API. Use of ~custom~elements~ !important on :host to target important general properties
[/] 3. Allow mouse use? Allow user shortcut re-mapping?
[*] 4. Allow windows-only to avoid injecting scripts. Turns out this shit ain't possible.
